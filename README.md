## Hi! 👋

I'm Ilia, a 23 years old web developer from Latvia.

🧭 Co-Founder at [@deltatheta-finance](https://github.com/deltatheta-finance) and Founder at [@stabfi](https://github.com/stabfi)

💬 I'm curious about high-load web applications (both web 2.0 and 3.0) and love to find solutions for really complex problems.

🙋‍♂️ I am used to developing projects from scratch (building system and database architecture, developing business logic) and developing a product both alone and in a team.

## Skills
- 👨‍💻 JS, TS (5 years)
- 🧐 Vue.js (3 years)
- ⚙️ Solidity (2 years)
- 👁️ SASS, CSS
- 💽 PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB

I love to use Nest.JS (fastify) & PostgreSQL with TypeORM/Prisma as a stack for web projects. I developed products with more than a million users and real-time platforms with a constant online presence of more than a thousand users, with a huge amount of parallel events.
